Database Systems Semester Project

Was the homework we were given in 4th semester for Database Systems lecture,
my teammates were [cooyit](https://github.com/cooyit) and [OzbekFurkan](https://github.com/OzbekFurkan), who were responsible for majority of the Database design and queries with join operations.
